### Hi there 👋, 
<p>I'm a student exploring the internet! I have been working on some cool projects and was hoping to share them with the rest of the internet. I'm hoping to find new challenges to tackle and learn from others.</p>

### Speed Trap 🚗
<p> Speed Trap is my second game released on the Google Playstore. Speed Trap is a 3D, arcade, police chase game designed in Unity using the C# language. It includes day/night cycles, animations, particle effects, and numerous vehicles. It also contains a highscore leaderboard that is actively updated throught the internet. This is my second game to be monetized through the use of ads (Google Admob). Be sure to check it out and give it a rating ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
